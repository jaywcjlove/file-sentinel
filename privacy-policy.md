Privacy Policy
===

Thank you for using FileSentinel! We take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting any personal information you provide while using our tool. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information.

## Information Collection

FileSentinel is a tool designed to monitor changes to text files, save the last line of content, and conveniently query terminal command history. It can monitor files like .zsh_history or .bash_history, automatically saving shell command history to help you quickly search recent terminal commands, preventing you from forgetting important ones. The app supports full-text search and command bookmarking, improving your work efficiency.

Important Note: FileSentinel is a local tool and does not collect, store, or process any personal data from users. We do not transmit any information to remote servers or third-party services through FileSentinel.

### a. Local Data Storage

- FileSentinel monitors and processes locally stored shell history files (such as .zsh_history or .bash_history), but this data is used solely on your device.
- All monitored data, settings, and actions are stored locally on your device. FileSentinel does not collect, access, or send this data to external servers.

### b. Log Data

FileSentinel does not collect any log data or usage information. All data operations and history queries are performed entirely on your device and are not transmitted to any remote servers or third-party services.

## Use of Data

Since FileSentinel does not collect, store, or analyze any user information, we do not use or share your personal information in any way. All data you use (such as terminal command history, search records, etc.) is processed solely on your local device.

## Third-Party Services

FileSentinel does not integrate with any third-party services or advertising platforms, so your information is not shared or sold to any third parties.

## Data Security

We place great importance on the security of your data. Since FileSentinel does not collect or transmit any data, all content, settings, and user actions are securely stored on your device and protected by your operating system’s security measures.

## User Control

- You can delete all data and settings within the FileSentinel app at any time. The app does not back up your data to the cloud; all data is entirely under your control.
- After uninstalling the app, all data will be permanently deleted from your device.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If there are significant changes, we will notify you via the app or official website. Please check this page regularly for the latest privacy policy updates.
